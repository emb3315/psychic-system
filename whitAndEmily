  <h3>Adventures of MegaButt and Stepmom</h3>
  <p>Just because we can't be together as much as we'd like, doesn't mean we don't love each other and have fun things to share. This can be our little portal for sharing our love and adventures.
  
 I was looking at fall fun activities. I want to take you to a pumpkin patch, and I want to take you apple picking, and I want to take you to a corn maze.
 I have so many things I want to do with you. Now we just have to get your idiotic father on board.
    Here is a <a href="cities.html">list</a> of cities where you can find us.</p>
